 \subsection{Recapitulating the results}
 To recap slightly from the previous chapter: Overall, the highest accuracy was obtained using MFCC over a window of 5ms with a skip of 2ms, with $k=7$ and $k=8$. Our $X^2$ tests did not show a significant difference even once, so our null-hypothesis stands true. This was unexpected, although some probabilities come very close, so perhaps the result might look different in future tests (with slightly different data due to randomization).
