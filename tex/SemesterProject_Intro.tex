Our final problem statement is: \textit{How can we automatically transcribe beatboxing}. To explain in other words: we record, analyse, and classify beatboxing according to part of the Standard Beatboxing Notation (SBN), more specifically the three beatboxing classes kick ('k'), snare ('s'), and highhat ('hh'). We implemented the system in Matlab\sup{\textregistered}.


Since we have quite a broad problem statement, there are many measures we could evaluate upon, as both audio features, segmentation, and classification are critical parts of our application. Even if only evaluating on the classifier, the number of combinations of features, and parameters of features (window size and window skip), is huge. We want keep a single independent variable. To limit ourselves, we chose not to test any combinations of features, but rather single features one at a time. We will then test that feature for $K \in [1;10]$. We state the null hypothesis that \emph{two knn-classifiers with a different k and otherwise identical, will not result in significantly different confusion tables.}
